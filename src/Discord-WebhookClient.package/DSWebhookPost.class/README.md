I represent Discord Webhook object that can be send as JSON or multipart/form-data format to a Discord Webhook API.
I am an abstract class.

I am used by DSWebhookClient in order to construct a message to be send to a Discord Webhook.

See documentation at https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#jsonform-params.
