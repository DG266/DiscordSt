I represent Discord Gateway Dispatch Payload Message used for communication between a client and a server.

I am used in case that an unhandled event is received. For such case see DSGatewayMessageReceiver>>#value: and visitDSGatewayDispatchPayload: messages.

See documentation at https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-op-codespayloads
