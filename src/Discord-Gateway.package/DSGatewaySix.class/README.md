I am a Discord Gateway API used for real-time communication.
I represent the version five of the Discord API.

Gateways are Discord's form of real-time communication over secure websockets. Clients will receive events and data over the gateway they are connected to and send data over the REST API.

See https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateways
