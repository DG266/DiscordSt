I represent Discord Gateway Identify Payload Message used for communication between a client and a server.

It is sent to the server when new WebSocket connection is established and HELLO payload received.

See documentation at https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-op-codespayloads

It includes Hello Event: DSGatewayIdentityEvent as dataEvent.
